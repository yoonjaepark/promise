# Promise 
`Promise` is a pattern that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value. ECMAScript 6 (or ES6) introduces it and is widely used to simplify the workflow. This assignment is to implement `Promise` class with vanilla JavaScript (ES5 or ES6). You could see all the specification of Promise here, and the following methods should be implemented. 
* new Promise(executor) 
* Promise.all(iterable) (supposed that iterable is the type of Array<Promise>) 
* Promise.resolve(reason) 
* Promise.reject(value) 
* Promise.prototype.then(func) 
* Promise.prototype.catch(func) 
* Promise.prototype.finally(func) 
  - Just guarantee that it should run on the latest version of Chrome browser.
